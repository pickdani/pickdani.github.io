I've been programming since High School, where I took the one programming class offered and loved it. This led me to Boston to pursue a CS degree at Northeastern, with a concentration in AI. I was captivated by the ability to make predictions using vast of datasets, transform human interactions, and revolutionize industries. The rapid pace at which technology propels society forward continues to inspire me. I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects, and you can reach me at pickett.d@northeastern.edu
