Currently, I'm in Boston studying CS at [Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="_blank"}, finishing up my 2nd year. I've been programming since early High School, where I took the one programming class offered and enjoyed it a lot, mainly drawn to the fact that you could automate repetitive tasks and save yourself hours. 

I didn't realize until later how much more is possible. Whether that be making predictions using quantities of data I can't comprehend, changing how people interact, or reinventing entire industries; I'm fascinated by how quickly technology can push society forward and where it will lead. I'm set to graduate in May of 2023 with a B.S. in CS, concentration in AI, minor in mathematics, and always looking for meaningful projects to be apart of. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to podcasts (or random clubhouse talks), exploring around Boston + trying different foods, or (when I'm home in NY) hanging with my dog stormy.
