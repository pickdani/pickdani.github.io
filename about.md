Currently, I'm in Boston studying CS at [Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="_blank"} in my 3rd year. I've been programming since High School; I took the one programming class offered and enjoyed it a lot, mainly drawn to the fact that you could automate repetitive tasks and save yourself hours. I didn't realize until later how much more is possible. Whether that is making predictions using quantities of data I cannot comprehend, changing how people interact or reinventing entire industries, I'm fascinated by how quickly technology can push society forward and where it will lead.

I'm set to graduate in May of 2023 with a BS in CS, concentration in AI, minor in mathematics, and I am always looking for meaningful projects to be a part of. I've recently completed a six-month Software Engineering Co-op at FM Global, doing full-stack development. I'm currently looking for a second Co-op for Summer/Fall 2022.
